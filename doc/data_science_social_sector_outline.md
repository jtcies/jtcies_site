## part 1: how to do this? 

- Deloitte article
  - prioritizing on the ground decision-making
  - data for advancing equity
- where are placed that this has worked?
  - examples:
    - Atlanta housing article?
    - Pittsburgh DHS model
    - Philly pre-k
  - common elements
    - focus on parternship
    - prioritizing decision-making, implementation
    - shared understanding of goals, activities, outcomes

## part 2: go beyond metrics

- data science has power to automate, deprioritize performance measures, tracking
  - shift focus to implementation
- metrics are important, have their place
  - we can set up systems and processes to track these things in real time
  - data science makes this (somewhat) trivial
  - can go beyond performance metrics
- the hard part is getting clear onw hat it is we should be tracking
  - in doing this, we have the opportunity to go deeper
  - need to get explicit about what we're doing, what we're trying to achieve
- dig deeper into implementation
  - real-time feedback, rather than relying on academics/contracted reseachers
  - requires shared understanding of goals, activities, outcomes

## part 3: developing shared understandings

- how to develop shared understandings
  - start with extracting the ideal
  - use data to examine what is actually happening
- provide opportunities for parternship, analyzing together
- start with simple visualizations and buidl up to more complex models
- this is an idealzied version; still working on implementing this cycle
