title: "Quantifying uncertainty around the short MLB season"

<p>This year’s going to be a weird year for baseball. Many have commented how the shortened season could lead to some weird final results, with highest ranked teams finishing lower than expected or some pretty bad teams ending with a decent record. This is because the outcome of any one game of baseball contains relatively little information about which team is actually better in the long run.</p>
<p>The question then, is what’s the amount of uncertainty we have about how teams will finish compared to a normal season? Seems like a problem for Bayesian statistics …</p>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>We’ll build a simple model to predict a team’s wins using their preseason odds of winning the World Series. We’ll use 2019 data to build the model, and then see how how the results change using the 2020 odds comparing a normal season to a short one.</p>
<p>First we’ll scrape the data on 2019 results and odds for 2019 and 2020.</p>

<p>First let’s take a look at the distributions. Below is a plot that shows win percentage of a team that is expected to win 50% of their games based on 100,000 simulations of seasons either normal lengths (162 games) or shortened (60 games).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>short &lt;- rbinom(1e5, 60, prob = 0.5) / 60
long &lt;- rbinom(1e5, 162, prob = 0.5) / 162

             subtitle = &quot;based on 100,000 simulations&quot;,

<p>In our imaginary world where this team has a 50% probability of winning every game, in short season that team would end up winning 40% or fewer of its games 7.8% of the time, while in a normal season that would only happen 0.5%of the time.</p>

<p>Clearly there is a much wider range of plausible outcomes for the short season. But those ranges look pretty wide in either scenario, and just looking at win percentage doesn’t really tell the whole story. Really we’re concerned with the variation in the possible final positions of each team within their division. So how does that change?</p>

<p>Some things really stand out here. First, at the extreme ranges, there isn’t actually that much variation. Its really unlikely the Yankees or Dodgers finish out of first, and its also really unlikely that the worst teams - Marlins, Orioles, and Tigers - will finish above last.</p>
<p>A lot of these divisions have a lot of potential outcomes regardless of whether it’s a short or long season. For example, this model predicts that the Cardinals or the Braves could finish first or fourth regardless of how long the season is.</p>
<p>Where things will potentially shake out in weird ways is in the middle of the pack. The table below shows the teams where the difference in the likelihood of a team finishing in a particular position between the shortened and a full season. The Blue Jays and the Royals both finish in fourth around 75% of time in the full season but just 55% of the time in the shortened season.</p>

<p>The baseball season will potentially shake out in really interesting ways this year. Some of this is due to the shortened season, and some of this is due existing parity in baseball.</p>
