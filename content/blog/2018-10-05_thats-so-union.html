<p>The phrase “that’s so Union” has come to mean shorthand for Philadelphia’s soccer team losing games that it should win. The team’s penchant for being “Uniony” was on full display recenlty when the Union were blown off the park by a seemingly inferior Houston Dynamo team at the U.S. Open Cup final. The Union were coming off a good streak, having won their two most recent games against the top two teams in the Western Conference. Just a few days before the cup final, they had soundly defeated a very good Sporting Kansas City team using only two of their normal starters. The Union were in the middle of a playoff push and feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>Houston on the other hand had been struggly recently in their MLS games and were all but knocked out of the playoffs. They had barely advanced to the cup final on penalties over LAFC.</p>
<p>However, the game felt like the opposite was the case. The Union had an early goal called back; immediately after, Houston sent the ball down the other side of the pitch and scored. From then on, Philadelphia seemed to lack any energy or creativity in their offensive end while Houston had a number of powerful counter attacks scoring two more goals before it was all said and done.</p>
<p>This feeling is one that Union fans are familiar with. In recent years, it seems that every run of good form quickly fizzles out; it can feel like the team lacks the perserverance to</p>
<p>I find myself asking sometmies though, ‘is it really this bad or am I just getting caught up in the negativity that is so common in Philadelphia sports?’</p>
<p>The answer some of these questions, I wanted to take a look at the data. I collected the scores of all MLS games from 1998 forward. Using those scores, I calculated Elo ratings for each team, a metric familiar to readers of Fivethirtyeight’s sports content, and a likelihood of winning each game.</p>
<p>In particular, I was interested in two questions:
- Are the Union more likley to lose games when they are favored than other teams?
- Are the Union more likley to have</p>
