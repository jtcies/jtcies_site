### [American Museum Membership Conference - September 2020](https://www.americanmuseummembership.org/)

## Abstract

In this session I will introduce participants to customer lifetime value (LTV) as a metric, including what it is, how to calculate it, and how to use it. I will start with a description of its benefits and limitations. We will then calculate LTV using example data. If possible, I would like to request that participants to bring a laptop so calculate LTV along with me. I will then discuss how to use this metric, particularly in acquisition efforts. I will end with a discussion of how to adapt for mission-driven organizations.  

Key takeaways: 

 - Understanding of LTV and its benefits and limitations 
 - Basic idea of how to calculate LTV using organizationâ€™s data 
 - Understanding of how to use LTV, particularly in acquisition efforts
