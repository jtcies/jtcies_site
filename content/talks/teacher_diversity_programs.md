title: "Recruitment and Retention Programs to Increase Teacher Diversity"
---

### Section from *The State of Teacher Diversity in America* (2015)

## Methods and Rationale

A national search, using primarily online tools and program websites, was conducted to identify state and local programs that aim to recruit and retain minority teachers. Programs were included in this review if they combine recruitment and retention aspects (even if the focus on retention isnâ€™t explicit), have an external evaluation or solid documentation of results, and are still active. Data were collected by reviewing websites, reports, peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters and independent evaluations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with program directors and/or sta whenever possible in order to ascertain strengths, challenges and next steps.
