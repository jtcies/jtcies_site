### [Forum for Opportunity and Justice hosted by ECS - October 2018](https://ecsphilly.org/news-events/forum-justice-opportunity/) 

In this talk I discuss why looking at data frequently doesn't lead to the change or improvement we seek. Data alone may be able to identify areas of growth but does not provide clear solutions. In order for data to influence decision-making, organizations and inititiaves need to have a strong foundation of shared understanding about goals and implementation. Frequently described as 'theories of change', these frameworks should be as specific as possible and publicly documented so they can act as a guide in decision-making processes. I offer some ideas and resources for ways to get started in building shared understandings.
