## Abstract

Organizations in the non-profit sector often collect lots of data that only gets used for compliance and performance monitoring. How can we sue this information to deepen our understanding of program implemntation and improve outcomes for participants? This talk focuses on how our organization used the tools and principles associated with the 'Tidyverse' to transform our data use from an excercise in counting to a resource for supporting program improvement, ultimately leading to higher quality experiences for participants.
